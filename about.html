    <p>Raina was one of the few best fielders during his time with Indian team. He played in middle order.[40]

        During the semi-final of 2011 Cricket World Cup, Raina batted with tailenders to score an unbeaten 36, a
        significant contribution to India's final tally of 260. [41]

        Apart from a half-century in the first Test of India tour of England 2011 at Lord's, Raina managed just 27 runs
        from seven innings. He struggled against short bowling and in the final Test was out for a 29-ball duck, the
        longest in India's Test history.[42][43]

        In the second ODI of Indian tour of Sri Lanka 2012, he was out for 1 but he came back stronger in the third ODI
        where he played 45 balls 65 to hand India a five-wicket win and he eventually also won the man of the match
        award for his performance. Gambhir too scored a century in that match.[44] After the Tour of Sri Lanka, when the
        England team came to India, he was dropped and his spot was given to Yuvraj Singh, who made a comeback after
        suffering from cancer.[45]</p>
